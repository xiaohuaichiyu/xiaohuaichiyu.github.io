Since they started dating over three years ago, Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have always been extremely private about their relationship, rarely giving the public any insights into their personal lives. But in an interview ==with== Zane Lowe on Apple Music, the pop star opened up about her boyfriend and how sad music actually brought them closer together.

“Joe and I really love sad songs. We've always bonded over music,” the singer（替换前文pop star） told Lowe. “We write the saddest songs. We just really love sad songs. What can I say?” After much fan speculation, Swift confirmed last month that it is, in fact, Alwyn who helped her write “Exile” and “Betty” on her album Folklore, as well as three more tracks ==off/ from== her latest Evermore, all under the pseudonym William Bowery.

She added, “It was a surprise that we started writing together. But ==in a way==, it wasn't because we have always bonded over music and had the same ==musical tastes==. He's always just playing instruments and he doesn't do it in a strategic, 'I'm writing a song right now' thing. He's always done that.” ==That being said==, she doesn't think writing music together would've happened organically if it wasn't for lockdown, “But I'm so glad that it <u>did</u>.”

==In case== it wasn't clear that Swift is still very much enamored with Alwyn after all this time, a source also told People this week that she “is very happy” with the actor. “He is her rock. Their relationship is mature and wonderful.” The source went on to say that she “loves” that they “have been able to keep their relationship so private” all this time and they “are looking forward to celebrating Christmas together.”
